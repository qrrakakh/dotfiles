o ... Introduction

  This module introduces BIG5 conversions on Mule-UCS.
As you know, almost all characters in BIG5 can be mapped to CNS
characters set.  One of the purpose of this module is unification
of duplicated character codes.

  There are two methods to unify BIG5 character sets into others.
One is using UCS representation, i.e., they are mapped to UCS,
then such UCS representation are mapped into other character
sets.  The other method is directly mapped into CNS character set
(a few exceptional characters are mapped to other character sets,
e.g., GB 2312.).  This translation method is defined in RFC1922.

  big5c-ucs.el module realize the first method, and big5c-cns.el
module realize the last one.

  big5c-ucs.el uses Mule-UCS-Unicode module defined mainly by
un-define.el.  Therefore you must install Mule-UCS-Unicode modules
beforehand. big5c-ucs.el requires un-define.el(that is the module of
Mule-UCS-Unicode).

  the conversion defined by big5c-cns was edited by Kawabata-san,
which directly convert BIG5 characters into mainly CNS 11643 character
set, and other characters that CNS have no correspondence are mapped
into GB 2312 or JIS X 0208 character sets; and vice versa.

o ... Installation

First of all, you should install Mule-UCS itself beforehand.

For byte-compilation, you can use big5-comp.el in the same directory
where this README is.

Enter the following command line:

  emacs(xemacs) -batch -q --no-site-file -l big5-comp.el

If you use Meadow, enter the following:

  Meadow95(NT) -batch -q --no-site-file -l big5-comp.el

And you will obtain byte-compiled files, big5c-ucs.elc
and big5c-cns.elc.
Then, you should install all files in big5conv directory
to your site-lisp directory.
Finally, add the below line to your .emacs or the startup file.
---
(require 'big5c-ucs)
---
or
---
(require 'big5c-cns)
---
It depends on which conversion methods you would like to use.

o ... Brief instruction

  This module configure big5-conv-* coding system, and
set coding-category-big5 to big5-conv.  Notice that this coding system
supports (mainly) CNS character sets internally --- not BIG5!  When inputing
characters under this coding system, you should confirm whether such characters
are of CNS.
  This coding system cannot encode BIG5 character set of emacs-mule.
If you save any documents that contains BIG5 characters, your Emacs
will display a warnning that this coding system cannot encode
this document safely.
  If your choise is big5-ucs, you can configure the mapped charsets
from BIG5 by modifying big5-conv-ucs-translation, because this
translation rule is declared as a dynamic translation rule.
You can apply tae-modify-translation to it.
