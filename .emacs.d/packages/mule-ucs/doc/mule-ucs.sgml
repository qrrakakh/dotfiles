MULE-UCS is a coding system and character code translator system.  This has
an universal ability to translate from any character sets to any, and
constract new coding systems easily.

<p>

And MULE-UCS have a package to translate between MULE INTERNAL CODE and
ISO-10646, So you can handle ISO-10646 based coding systems on
Emacs/Mule(But can't work on 20.2, this version have no extended CCL), Mule
3.0 and Meadow.

<h1> Design goal
<node> Designgoal
<p>
MULE-UCS is a character code translator system.
I set the goal of this system as follows.
<p>

<dl>
<dt> map character codepoint. 
<dd> MULE-UCS have to map character codepoint fast, and give a flexible way
to change mapping policy. </dd>
<dt> utilize character codetables
<dd> MULE-UCS can handle multiple codepoint tables, and then reorganize many
character set. </dd>
<dt> generate coding system.
<dd> MULE-UCS can generate coding systems from your own translation rule.
Of course including a CCL to convert font codepoint.
</dl>
<p>

MULE-UCS have following supplementary features, too.
<ul>
<li> Very biased(:-P) MULE-INTERNAL and ISO-10646 translator. and
ISO-10646 coding-system. </li>
<li> Convertor tables from text representation to MULE-UCS awarable emacs
lisp representation. </li>
</ul>

<h1> MULE-UCS overview.
<node> overview
<p>

MULE-UCS consists of these modules mainly.

<ol>
<li> Association compiler.
<li> Table organizer.
<li> CCL generator.
</ol>

<dl>
<dt> Association compiler.
<dd> On MULE-UCS, codepoint mapping rule is described by association
list(alist).  Association compiler generate table set from an assocation
list for encoding and decoding.  Association compiler also optimize tables.
<dt> Table oranizer.
<dd> Table Organizer can
